# World Development Indicators: Population Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the World Development Indicators dataset, focusing on population data as part of my data science internship with Prodigy Infotech.

## Overview

In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the population dataset from the World Development Indicators to uncover patterns and insights related to population changes over the years.

## Data Cleaning Process

- **Handled Missing Values:**
  - Dropped rows with missing values for simplicity.

- **Filtered Data:**
  - Extracted relevant population data for specific countries.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Population Distribution by Year:**
  - Visualized the distribution of population over the years for selected countries.



## Getting Started

To run the analysis, you will need to install the following libraries:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib
